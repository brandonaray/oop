And we're looking at each other as if each other were to blame
You think you're so smart but I've seen you naked
And I'll probably see you naked again
Milli Vanilli told you to blame it on the rain
But if you blame it on the rain tell me what can be gained so
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails blame it on me
But if all else fails you can blame it on me
Then you smile again
But you're looking at me like there's something I'm supposed to say
Forgive me, Father But I'm falling in love
And that's all I have for confession today
Maybe if you'd ask me on any other Given day
I wouldn't have time for you or anything that you say
But it's alright now, you can blame it on me
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails blame it on me
But if all else fails you can blame it on me
Yes dear I love you
But sometimes I think that love's not Enough for you
So you want to play mind games
Well that's fine, go ahead, la la la I can't hear you
But here you are and you're a hundred thousand miles away, yeah
They say that absence makes the heart grow fungus
I wax poetic as you're waxing your legs
Oh, you say there's a traitor among us (whoa, oh oh oh oh)
If all else fails you can blame it on me (you can blame it on me)
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails blame it on me
But if all else fails you can blame it on me"))

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way
Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter 'n' 'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever (The one in front of the gun forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel"))
list.add_song(Song.new("Under Pressure", "David Bowie & Queen", 247, "Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
